#+title: Readme
* Hello! Welcome!
Here are my dotfiles! I cannot promise that they are any good, but if you need
them hopefully they will be useful!

NOTE: I type with a Colemak-DH layout, so my dotfiles (particularly skhd)
reflect this.

TODO: tangle all of these configs so they are even easier to read!
